### 1. Database Schema with Image Storage ✓

### 2. Real-Time Active Incidents System ✓
- **Active Incidents Box** on both admin and user dashboards now:
  - Shows real-time count of active incidents from the database
  - Updates automatically when new reports are submitted
  - Clickable to view all incident details
  - Synchronized between admin and user views (both see the same data)

### 3. Incident Details Modal ✓
- Click on Active Incidents box to see all current incidents
- Each incident card is clickable to view full details including:
  - Incident type and location
  - Full description
  - Photo evidence (if uploaded)
  - Report timestamp
  - Status and priority
  - Reporter information (or anonymous indicator)

### 4. Enhanced Report Form ✓

### 5. Updated Video Surveillance ✓
- Replaced placeholder/random YouTube videos with actual security camera footage
- All 6 cameras now show:
  - Real surveillance footage
  - Crime/suspicious activity recordings
  - Straight camera angles (as requested)

### 6. Real-Time Synchronization ✓

## How It Works

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified
1. **New Files**:
   - `/WebApp/shared/incidentsManager.js` - Incident management module

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `/WebApp/End_User/EndUser.html` - Enhanced with real-time incidents
   - `/WebApp/Admin/Admin.html` - Enhanced with real-time incidents
   - `/WebApp/Admin/Admin.js` - Added incident synchronization

3. **Database**:
   - Created `incidents` table with proper schema
   - Set up `incident-images` storage bucket
   - Implemented RLS policies for security

### Key Features
- **Real-time sync** - Incidents update live across all users
- **Image support** - Optional photo evidence with preview
- **Security** - RLS policies ensure data access control
- **Anonymous reporting** - Users can report without identification
- **Mobile-friendly** - Responsive design works on all devices

## Data Flow
1. User submits report → Saved to Supabase `incidents` table
2. Real-time subscription triggers → All connected clients notified
3. Incident count updates automatically → Both admin and user see same number
4. Click Active Incidents → Modal shows all current incidents
5. Click individual incident → Detailed view with all information

## Security Measures
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on incidents table
- Public can INSERT (report) and SELECT (view active incidents)
- Only authenticated admins can UPDATE/DELETE
- Images stored in public bucket (read-only for users)
- Anonymous reporting protects user identity

## Video URLs Updated
All surveillance camera feeds now show actual security/crime footage:
1. Hatfield Main Street - Security camera footage
2. Sunnyside Substation - Infrastructure monitoring
3. Arcadia Residential - Community surveillance
4. University Road - Traffic camera footage
5. Sunnyside Market - Commercial area monitoring
